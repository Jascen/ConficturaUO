AccessLevelStone

The name pretty much says it, this stone allows a staffmember to toggle between 
Player and his AccessLevel, if the stone is used by someone else than his owner, 
if this person has greater accesslevel than the owner, he becomes the owner, elseway 
the stone is deleted.

just drop in your scripts\ folder ^^
