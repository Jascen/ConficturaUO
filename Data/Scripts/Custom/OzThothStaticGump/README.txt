You cannot have both of the Static Gumps working at the same time.  It is advised to use one or the other.

Please Test both and see which one works with your server and which one doesn't.  It is recommended that if
you can use the original version to use that one as it it's a little more pliable.  The alternative version
is built without much customization to the gump as possible to ensure that it won't throw any errors, but
with that it takes up a tad more space and is far more clunky.  If you can use the first version that is in
this zip file, PLEASE do.  If you can't, use the Alternative version.  Do NOT I repeat DO NOT use both at the
same time.
