The offline clone will have all of the character's stats, skills, and items equipped that the original character had on when they logged out.

There have been some bugs reported and some bugs fixed thanks to all of the new players who have joined the server.
-----
Info:
There are almost 300 classic artifacts in the game, as well as artifacts created for this game that are specifically named and designed. These are items like 'Stormbringer' or 'Conan's Lost Sword'. By default, these items will retain their appearance and color no matter what is done to them.
